        <p class="descriptor">A perfectionist of nearly 37 years, I've embarked on a journey to break this toxic trait through time spent transforming raw clay into unique, functional art pieces, in our local not-for-profit Chattanooga, TN based pottery studio: Scenic City Clay Arts. From shaping forms on the wheel or by hand and experimenting with glazes, pottery constantly challenges me to appreciate the beauty inherent in the small imperfections that make us who we are. &#9786;</p>

        <p class="descriptor">The daughter of an architect and career artist, it perhaps should come as no surprise that I find joy in bringing blank canvases to life with colors and design. My work can be found in the Grant Park Gallery and Buckhead Art Gallery in Atlanta, GA, and in private collections across the nations. Painting fuels my passion for self-expression and inspires new perspectives in everything I do. &#9786;</p>

        <p class="descriptor">Years ago, I began a journey to obtain my private pilot's license. Occasionally you will find me at the local airport with a flight instructor, taking to the skies. I've had a lifelong interest in one day constructing my own kit plane. But for now, I'm still a student just learning the ropes. &#9786;</p>
