This personal website serves as a central hub of work samples. It includes an About page that provides insights into my background and interests, as well as a portfolio section with samples of my projects. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site demonstrates responsive design, interactivity, and modern web development practices. The repository also includes examples of merging multiple branches into the main branch, highlighting my ability to collaborate effectively and manage code versioning in a structured workflow.
